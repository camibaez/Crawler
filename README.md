# Description
Welcome to the Web Crawler Project. The crawling process has been implemented using ideas from Intelligent Agents design, where each crawler is an independent agent that executes its own tasks coordinated by a central agent.

# Class relations
The Crawler agent request links to the CrawlingCentral in order to extract the links in the page. All the active crawlers are contained in a list inside the CrawlingCentral.
