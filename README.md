# Description
Welcome to the Web Crawler Project.
The crawling process have been implemented using ideas from Intelligent Agents design, 
where each crawler is a independent agent that does its own task coordinated by an central agent. 

# Classes
The Crawler agent request links to the CrawlingCentral in order to extract the links in the page. All the active crawlers are contained in a list inside the CrawlingCentral.
